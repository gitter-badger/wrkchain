WRKChain SDK
============

This directory contains everything required to get started running a WRKChain. 

**Note**: Unless modifications are made to the configuration, there is no need
to run this SDK more than once. The files generated in the
`build` directory can be packaged and distributed to all hosts in the
configuration.

Please refer to either the generated `documentation.html` or `documentation.md` 
located in this directory for further information on running your WRKChain.
